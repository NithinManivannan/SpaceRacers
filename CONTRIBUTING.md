## Development Progress

"Space Racers" is actively evolving. Core mechanics are in place, but we're refining collision and physics dynamics. We invite collaborators to help enhance these aspects. See [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) for issues and enhancements to be added.

We openly encourage contributions and suggestions that can assist in addressing these challenges. If you have expertise in Unity's physics and collision systems or have encountered similar hurdles in your projects, your insights could be incredibly valuable to our progress.
