## Existing Issues
- **Collision and Physics**: There are known issues with collision detection and physics responses that may affect gameplay. We're working on refining these to create a more fluid experience.

## Proposed Enhancements
- **Infinite Track Generation**: We're exploring the potential of integrating AI-driven procedural track generation to enable an infinite racing experience.
- **Multi-Player**: Multiple people being able to compete for the best time, either online or locally on one system

Contributions to address these issues or to enhance the game are highly welcomed.
